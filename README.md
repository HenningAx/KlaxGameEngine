The KlaxEngine is a C# based game engine that was created as a Bachelor project by Valentin Klink (https://github.com/Schadek) and Henning Ax (https://github.com/HenningA).
The focus of the engine is to provide a prototyping framework by focusing on a visual scripting system.
It is not designed to produce complete games by more as an experimentation ground.
